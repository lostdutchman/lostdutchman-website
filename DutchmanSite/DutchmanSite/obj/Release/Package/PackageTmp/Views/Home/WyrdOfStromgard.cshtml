                    <p>In Norse lore, saying something out loud was to give it form, meaning, and power.  That's why fate was often called a "wyrd".  The Wyrd of Stromgard is just that- the power to shape heroic tales amidst chaos, violence, and magic.</p>

                    <p>Built on the <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a> ruleset and made from equal parts literature, lore, and legend, Stromgard is a broad world of magic and titanic threats, gods, monsters, and oracles.  Above all, it is a rich expansion setting that includes everything you need to run epic Norse campaigns</p>

                                <br />

                                <br />
                                <p>While the lore and ways of pre-Christian Scandanavia may have been obfuscated by the passage of time, the myths and legends that remain still captivate and inspire our fantasy realms.  While it isn't possible to achieve "historical accuracy" in most Viking themed games, Stromgard takes an approach that's more focused on the "feeling" of believability.  Stromgard's monsters, gods, and people were all inspired by real surviving documents- mostly the Poetic and Prose Eddas (arguably the most well-known collections of Norse myth) but also Beowulf, the Icelandic Sagas, and a few more modern Northern European and Celtic tales.</p>
                                <img style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 5px; float: right; height:372px; width:301px;" src="~/Content/img/Stromgard/beowulf.jpeg" class="img-fluid" />
                                <p>The Wyrd of Stromgard includes a chapter on historical sources and addresses some of the more prevalant facts and myths about Vikings and pagan Norse peoples.  This adds robust framework that GMs and players can utilize in creating characters, pulling from period-typical epic narrative, or simply roleplaying in a believable society regardless of what fantastic elements are also present.</p>
                                <p>Even if true historical accuracy is impossible, Stromgard seeks to present as believable of a setting as possible- having the academic context and research already prepared helps inform in-game decisions for both PCs and GMs and supports a deeply intricate, dynamic setting.</p>

                                <p>The realm of Stromgard is huge and contains a great amount of detail that GMs and players can alter, customize, or influence on the fly.  One of <a href="https://dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World's</a> guiding principles is <strong>draw maps, but leave blanks</strong> and Stromgard was designed to do exactly that- provide players with guidance and structure to support a sprawling, interconnected world and an epic narrative but there is always room for players to add or remove anything they wish without having to wrangle suddenly-nonfunctioning narrative threads. Here's the kind of information the book provides:</p>
                                <img style="padding: 10px 20px 5px 5px; float: left;" src="~/Content/img/Stromgard/mapsite.jpg" class="img-fluid" />
                                <h3>Society</h3>
                                <p>The Wyrd of Stromgard paints a detailed picture of what society is like as a backdrop for your adventures- <em>heaviliy</em> inspired by historic accounts, Stromgard lays out world that is multifaceted and engaging, at once rustic and mundane but also fantastic and otherworldly.  With plenty of information on economy, power structures, culture, and language players will have plenty of narrative hooks and intriguing details to work with right out of the gate.</p>
                                <h3>Races</h3>
                                <p>Stromgard is also home to several prominent races and a chapter has been dedicated to each of the most populous peoples in the realm- mortal and immortal elves, dvergar and mortal dwarves, gnomes, halflings, humans, and J&#246;tnar (or Ice Giants, as they are sometimes referred to).  Each chapter explores their unique histories and creation myths, sub-populations, political relationships, physcial appearances, and cultures.</p>
                                <h3>Warfare</h3>
                                <p>Vikings were most famous for their conquest through Europe and and The Wyrd of Stromgard provides plenty of background to help GMs recreate this turbulent and dangerous period with minimal effort.  A chapter on warfare covers common tactics, motiviations, naval capabilities, and cultural influences that take from the tales of historic Viking raids all over the known world. </p>
                                <h3>Mythos</h3>
                                <p>The world tree and it's nine realms are possibly the most iconic features of Norse myth and it has been incorporated into Stromgard in an easy-to-digest fashion without expecting players or GMs to study tons of old manuscripts.  Each of Yggdrasil's nine realms is explored succinctly but in detail, along with the gods that preside over them, their rank in the divine hierarchy, and their sphere of influence.</p>

                                <h3>Places</h3>
                                <p>A map and list of premade steadings is ready for GMs to utilize whenever they need and includes tags, detailed descriptions, and locations.</p>
                                <h3>The Arcane</h3>
                                <p>Magic's sway over Stromgard is discussed in a chapter of its own, including entries on Seeing and Wyrd-magic- perhaps not unique to Norse lore but certainly one of the most aesthetically typical facets of it.</p>

                                <h3>The Bearskin</h3>
                                <p>Channel a ferocious lust for battle and chaos into pure destruction.  Terrify your enemies, clear a bloody path to Valhalla, but beware your vulnerability once exhaustion rears its head and your fire burns dim.</p>
                                <h3>The Skald</h3>
                                <p>Learned and respected, you calling is to record the lineage of noble warriors and chieftains, settle matters of law, and sway the people's hearts.  It can be hard to tell which is sharper: your intellect or your bladepoint.</p>
                                <h3>The Hunter</h3>
                                <p>Unrestrained and brutal is your devotion to the Wild Hunt and the honor of bringing down worthy kills- you are the judge, jury, and executioner of your personal creed.  You repay violence with violence and add interest, striking fear into the hearts of those who earn your attention.</p>
                                <h3>The Stormcaller</h3>
                                <p>A powerful vessel for the essence of nature itself and a conduit for the strength and destruction ice and snow, wind and rain may bring.  You are a tempest in humanoid trappings, an avatar of the earth itself.</p>
                                <h3>The Crone</h3>
                                <p>Secret-Keeper, they call you... purify and blight, harm and heal, divine and obscure as you see fit.  After all, how can they defend against the shadows and sickness and nightmares you command?</p>
                                <h3>The Fae</h3>
                                <p>Flighty and unpredictable, you live as it pleases you- however that may be- and your deep connection to the forces that govern the worlds makes your powers limited only by your resourcefulness and wit. </p>
                                <h3>The Alfir</h3>
                                <p>A beacon of justice and order in a chaotic world, you are the hand of divine will, an enactor of the gods' justice.  The wilds are meant to be tamed and if you're met with primitive hostility, the point of your arrow serves almost as keenly as your sharp tongue.</p>
                                <h3>The Troll</h3>
                                <p>An unfortunate whim of nature leaves you weak to sunlight and victim to the mobs that call you a monster.  You are a steward of your ancestral lands and slowly losing even that right as humans populate unchecked.  But you could take it back, if you wanted.  Your strength is unmatched, the your form inspires terror, and your appetite for flesh play to the mortals' deepest fears.</p>
                                <h3>The Dvergr</h3>
                                <p>Paragon of the dwarves and master craftspeople of all nine realms, you are famed for pragmatism and forging- the skillful way art, science, and magic are woven together to create objects powerful enough for even Odin himself.  While your kind is insular and mysterious, the wide worlds offer resources and inspiration, two commodities invaluable to any master artist.</p>
                                <h3>The Jotunnborn</h3>
                                <p>A product of many worlds, you'll find that some are more readily accepting of outsiders and misfits than others.  You carry the ancient wisdom of the J&ouml;tnar, the first and most ancient people, in your veins and their strength is hard coded into your very flesh.</p>
                                <br />
                                <h2>Compendium Classes</h2>
                                <h3>The Seidr</h3>
                                <p>Read the wyrd of any person or object and proclaim the will of fate.  Your abilities came with a heavy price but the truth they deliver may be the biggest burden of all.</p>
                                <h3>The Runecaster</h3>
                                <p>Words have always been a source of power in Stromgard, whether they are spoken by a seer or written by the skillful hand of the runecaster.</p>
                                <h3>The Voyager</h3>
                                <p>You took the title of Viking and sailed south to find your fortune, braving the cold expanse of hell that is open ocean.</p>
                                <h3>The Fae-Touched</h3>
                                <p>Lord, what fools these mortals be to take loaded bargains from Faefolk.  Not only does it bind them to such capricious creatures but it changes them forever in other ways- the mark of a Fae is everlasting, after all.</p>
                                <h3>The Ulfhednar</h3>
                                <p>When a Bearskin makes a solemn vow to use their wild rage-strength to protect a defenseless charge, they take on this sacred wolf-hood.  Pity then that their own fury and power can sometimes be the most dangerous thing on a battlefield.</p>
                                <h3>The Unsavage</h3>
                                <p>Social structure and norms can be quite a tool to leverage, if one were pragmatic and clever enough to utilize them to their own advantage.</p>
                                <h3>The Ghost Rider</h3>
                                <p>Drag the unpunished sinners of the world kicking and screaming to the ghostly calvalcade that is the Wild Hunt.  The only thing more satisfying than seeing justice served is presenting these guilty miscreants to the lady of Helheim herself</p>

                                <p>Stromgard is home to a wide variety of monsters and other potential threats and to assist you in roleplaying this dynamic setting, the book includes a detailed monster manual with illustrated entries plus additional monsters as part of the included campaign for a total almost 30 unique monsters to offer your party challenges in any form.  Additionally, monsters range in personality from benevolent and skittish (like the Bicorn) to hellbent on spreading pain and suffering (like the Fj&#246;ld), to statless, divine beings of pure primordial hate (like Surt).  The Wyrd of Stromgard makes it easy to find the right encounter for any situation, environment, and narrative.</p>

                                <p>The Wyrd of Stromgard also provides tools for GMs managing their parties in a way that offers some support and structure without requiring them to give up creative control.  In addition to impactful tables of items specially created with easy narrative extrapolation in mind, you'll also find aides like a name pool, NPC generator, plus an in-depth look at <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World's</a> GM Principles and general best-practice advice that's both practical and effective.</p>

                                <p><a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a> has been widely and deservedly recognized for the way it mechanizes and incentivises fast-thinking, narrative-focused roleplaying with its GM Principles.  It reduces a lot of the bulk of overly complex rulesets and focuses instead on common-sense answers while setting the pace to a more collaborative back-and-forth between the world and the characters within it.  In The Wyrd of Stromgard, we revisted each ofthe GM's guiding principles, elaborated on their importance, and gave some insight as to how to apply them within the extended Stromgard setting.</p>

PCs will face the emerging omens of Ragnarok in Danger One and then work through an extraplanar conspiracy, blood feuds, and furious titans before squaring up against the heralds of apocalypse themselves- Fenrir, Jormungandr, and Surt.  The adventure front has tons of information to set the stage and get you started, plus every danger has narrative hooks, impulses, major forces/cast, starting points to ask your players, and more.  Beyond even this, each danger has unique monsters, equipment, and moves to facilitate epic-level storytelling and roleplaying while keeping the whole endeavor easy to run, highly detailed, and flexible.  You can run the campaign exactly how it's written, pick and choose the elements you like best, or simply use it as a springboard for your own tale of cataclysmic danger.</p>
