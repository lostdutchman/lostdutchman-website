    <p>Nice Bowling is a quirky bowling game that is 100% committed to its aesthetic.  Modeled after the late 80's, early 90's obsession with chrome and neon, Nice Bowling's unique look and retro/chillwave soundtrack will really bring you back.  Gameplay is simple and clean, with a natural, responsive feel that tests your bowling prowess in a lighthearted environment.  Nice Bowling really shines in its 'added effect' playstyle.  Random events can trigger on any frame of play to a huge variety of outcomes- good luck bowling with a beach ball, a jelly blob, or a bouncy ball.  Sometimes fish rain from the sky and block the lane.  Sometimes there will be obsticals or ramps in your path.  Nice Bowling will be available on PC and mobile summer 2018.</p>
