                    <p>In Norse lore, saying something out loud was to give it form, meaning, and power.  That's why fate was often called a "wyrd".  The Wyrd of Stromgard is just that- the power to shape heroic tales amidst chaos, violence, and magic.</p>

                    <p>Built on the <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World</a> ruleset and made from equal parts literature, lore, and legend, Stromgard is a broad world of magic and titanic threats, gods, monsters, and oracles.  Above all, it is a rich expansion setting that includes everything you need to run epic Norse campaigns</p>

                            <br />
                            <p>While the lore and ways of pre-Christian Scandanavia may have been obfuscated by the passage of time, the myths and legends that remain to us still captivate audiences and color our fantasy worlds.  While it isn't possible to achieve "historical accuracy" in most Viking themed games, Stromgard takes an approach that's more focused on the "feeling" of believability.  Stromgard's monster, legends, gods, and figures were all inspired by real surviving documents- mostly the Poetic and Prose Eddas (arguably the most well-known collections of Norse myth) but also Beowulf, the Icelandic Sagas, and a few more modern Northern European and Celtic tales.</p>
                            <img style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 5px; float: right; height:372px; width:301px;" src="~/Content/img/Stromgard/beowulf.jpeg" class="img-fluid" />
                            <p>Stromgard includes a chapter on historical sources and addresses some of the more prevalant facts and myths about Vikings and pagan Norse peoples.  This adds robust framework that GMs and players can utilize in creating characters, pulling from period-typical narrative impetus, or simply roleplaying in a believable society (even if fantasy is an accepted element).  The oldest written sources of Norse lore, The Eddas, weren't penned until hundreds of years after their stories had supposedly taken place, which unfortunately adds some more contemporary bias.</p>
                            <p>While real historical accuracy is impossible and choosing a hard date somewhere on the timeline of the Viking Age isn't necessary in Stromgard, having the extra context and research already prepared helps inform decisions and support an intricate, dynamic setting.</p>

                            <br />
                            <p>The realm of Stromgard is huge and contains a great amount of detail that GMs and players can alter, customize, or influence on the fly.  One of <a href="https://dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World's</a> guiding principles is <strong>draw maps, leave blanks</strong> and Stromgard was designed to do exactly that- provide players with guidance and structure to support a believable world and an epic narrative but there is always room for players to add or remove anything they wish without having to wrangle suddenly-nonfunctioning narrative threads. Here's the kind of information the book provides:</p>
                            <img style="padding: 10px 20px 5px 5px; float: left;" src="~/Content/img/Stromgard/mapsite.png" class="img-fluid" />
                            <h3>Society</h3>
                            <p>The Wyrd of Stromgard seeks to provide a basic overview of what society is like as a backdrop for the rest of the game- <em>heaviliy</em> inspired by historic accounts, Stromgard lays out world that is detailed and engaging.  With information on economy, power structures, culture, and language players will have plenty of narrative hooks and intriging details to work with right out of the gate.</p>
                            <h3>Races</h3>
                            <p>Stromgard is also home to several prominent races and a chapter has been dedicated to each of the most populous peoples in the realm- mortal and immortal elves, dvergar and mortal dwarves, gnomes, halflings, humans, and Jotnar (or Ice Giants, as they are sometimes referred to).  Each chapter explores their unique histories and creation myths, sub-populations, political relationships, physcial appearances, and cultures.</p>
                            <h3>Warfare</h3>
                            <p>Vikings were most famous for their conquest through Europe and their push to ransack the land and The Wyrd of Stromgard provides setting knowledge to help GMs recreate this turbulent and dangerous period with minimal effort.  A chapter on warfare covers common tactics, motiviations, naval capabilities, and cultural influences that take from the tales of historic Viking raids. </p>
                            <h3>Gods and the Nine Realms</h3>
                            <p>The world tree and it's nine realms are possibly one of the most iconic features of Norse myth and it has been incorporated into Stromgard in an easy-to-digest fashion without having expected players or GMs to read many old manuscripts.  Each of Yggdrasil's nine realms is explored succinctly but in detail, along with the gods that preside over them, their rank in the divine hierarchy, and their sphere of influence.</p>
                            <h3>Places</h3>
                            <p>A map and list of premade steadings is ready for GMs to utilize whenever they need and include tags, detailed descriptions, and locations.</p>
                            <h3>The Arcane</h3>
                            <p>Magic's sway over Stromgard is discussed in a chapter of its own, including entries on Seeing and Wyrd-magic- perhaps not unique to Norse lore but certainly one of the most aesthetically iconic facets of it.</p>

                            <h2>Racial Classes</h2>
                            <p>The standard classes of Wyrd may be played by any semi-mortal race you choose- elves, dwarves, humans, gnomes, halflings, etc- and instead of the "Racial" starting move of standard Dungeon World, we've replaced it with a more open "Background" move, thereby making all classes available to all common races and alignments.</p>
                            <p>But The Wyrd of Stromgard also includes 5 racial classes.  These characters are, in some cases, literal demigods and come with unique backgrounds that make them unable to pick up traditional class abilities but are typically more powerful than the average bear, so to speak.  Racial Classes also come with a few hefty vulnerabilities to temper their strength a little, making them an ideal play choice for those looking for a little challenge.</p>
                            <br />                                                              
                        <a href="https://c1.staticflickr.com/5/4908/44014996930_b8f5d62a4b_b.jpg"><img style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 0px; float: left;" src="~/Content/img/Stromgard/fae.png" class="img-fluid" /></a><h3>The Fae</h3><p>The Fae are a varied people with many physical forms and inclinations but they all have agendas and they are all skilled at manipulation.  With unique setbacks like being unable to touch pure iron or stand the sound of bells, individual Fae make the most of their skills by entrancing mortals and magically binding them to contractual terms.  They'll also straight up shank you if they need.</p>
                            <h3>The Troll</h3>
                            <p>Trolls are a  huge, resilient people who make their homes in the mountain foothills of the world... which are slowly being overrun with humans and other mortals, building villages and cutting timber.  Trolls are hated, told as nighttime stories to misbehaving children, and for the most part they're hunted on sight.  But they're immensely powerful, could tear a fortified wall down with their bare hands, and fuel their monstrous regenerative powers by consuming huge amounts of food.  Their one weakness is the sun, whose warm light will cause flesh to seize and petrify almost instantly.</p>
                            <h3>The Dvergr</h3>
                            <p>The Dvergr are closely related to common dwarves and share some of their culture.  They are innately magical, however, and retain their more primal forms.  They are creatures of equal parts mundane flesh and living rock, an insular people that have a pragmatic approach to honor and oaths that makes it somewhat difficult to mesh with others.  Their affinity for the earth makes them the best smiths in the land and their deep connection to the higher gods make them an unorthodox but stalwart party addition.</p>
                            <h3>The Alfir</h3>
                            <p>Literally, the Light Elves.  The Alfir are a subrace of the Vanir, the lesser gods who don't reside is Asgard.  After several Vanir/Aesir conflicts, the Alfir have thrown their lot in with the power hierarchy coming out of Asgard.  They believe strongly that order and governance will bring all the realms into a peaceful age.  Above all they hate those who seek to keep the world wild and chaotic- personified by their almost universal predjudice against J&oumlntar and any who carry their blood.  Most mortal elves and even some rural humans worship the Alfir in some capacity.</p>
                            <h3>The Jotunnborn</h3>
                            <p>The J&oumltunnborn are a subgroup inside the wider J&oumltnar people, a race of pseudo-feral ice giants that- as a whole- reject the spread of civilization and hold true to the laws of nature and beasts.  Many J&oumltnar openly and violently rebel against the gods, giving rise to the popular belief that they are actively trying to usurp the gods by going so far as to trigger the apocalypse.  However, nearly every race- even including the high gods of Asgard- intermarry with J&oumltnar, making loyalties difficult to pin down at a glance.  J&oumltunnborn are just that, the product of a J&oumltnar marriage somewhere down the line who has retained some of their 'ice giant' heritage.  Most J&oumltunnborn have difficulty integrating into groups of people because of entrenched prejudice.</p>

                            <h2>The World</h2>
                            <p>Stromgard is a fictional realm within Midgard, the plane of mortals.  The people of Stromgard are hardy but poor and they value strength, self sufficiency, and honor.  They are a fairly lawful sort, as much as can be expected in a collection of rural settlements, but reputation and morality are weighed heavily in the communities, especially in human ones. 
                            <h3>Societies</h3>
                            <p>Stromgard is primarily populated by humans, who live in a multitude of settlements strewn about the land.  Elves and dwarves both live in Stromgard in great numbers, the former gravitating towards their forest cities and the latter burrowing into every mountain in the region.  Gnomes are also commonly found, typically living close to dwarven communities.  Halfings are also a staple of Stromgardian populations, though they typically only settle where the land is fertile and easily farmed.  More often than not, these societies tend to be racially insular to some degree, though there is no standing bad blood or open feuds between any of these groups as a whole.  Above looks and race, in Stromgard, your honor and strength say more about your worth across all communities.</p>
                            <h3>Conquest</h3>
                            <p>More than anything else, life in Stromgard is fueled by conquest and exploration.  Every spring, all of Stromgard sends out its finest sailors and most formidable warriors to find new land and sack the living hell out of it.  It is a brutal practice but the rewards and glory are plentiful.  As is the imminent danger of sea monsters, rival clans, and storms.  Warriors that bring new resources, settle far off lands or even make treaties with foreign ports are lavishly decorated on their return and their war spoils open many doors for them.</p>
                            <h3>The Nine Realms</h3>
                            <p>The gods say that the world as we know it sits spread out on the branches of a cosmic Ash tree, divided into nine separate realms, or planes, as follows:</p>
                            <div class="realms">
                            <p><strong>Asgard</strong> - Home to the Aesir gods and Odin, chief among them</p>
                            <p><strong>Vanaheim</strong> - Realm of the lesser gods, the Vanir</p>
                            <p><strong>Alfheim</strong> - Realm of the divine light elves</p>
                            <p><strong>Myrkheim</strong> - Ancestral home of the dwarven peoples</p>
                            <p><strong>Midgard</strong> - Realm of mortals, surrounded by J&oumltunheim, the icy land of the J&oumltnar</p>
                            <p><strong>Svaralfheim</strong> - Home of the rarely seen and extremely insular divine moon elves</p>
                            <p><strong>Hel</strong> - this realm, ruled by a goddess of the same name, houses the dead</p>
                            <p><strong>Niflheim</strong> - A special subrealm of Hel for the dishonorable dead</p>
                            <p><strong>Muspelheim</strong> - A plane of pure fire and ash that houses the fire giants and their god-king, Surt</p>
                            </div>
                                 
                            <h3>The Gods</h3>
                            <p>There are countless deities worshipped all over in varying capacities, but there are a few exalted powers that are ubiquitous throughout Stromgard.  Technically, even some ancient and immense J&oumltnar are considered to be gods in their own right.</p>
                            <div class="realms">
                                <p><strong>Odin</strong> - Chief among the Aesir deities.  Associated with wisdom, honorable warfare, and prophecy.  It is said that he wanders the world disguised as an old man.</p>
                                <p><strong>Thor</strong> - A noble and mighty warrior that champions honorable combat, battle prowess, and storms.  Sometimes, Thor is also associated with masculinity and virility, depending on the region.</p>
                                <p><strong>Tyr</strong> - The voice of law, logic, and reason in Asgard.  Tyr is associated with honorable glory and due process.</p>
                                <p><strong>Loki</strong> - An enigma.  Loki is considered an Aesir deity but his mixed J&oumltnar parentage make his motives difficult to understand.  Above all, Loki prizes cleverness and wits in his devotees and usually seeks to subvert convention as much as possible.  He is especially honored amongst the outcasted.</p>
                                <p><strong>Freya</strong> - The warrior goddess Freya is sometimes considered an Aesir and sometimes a Vanir, depending on the region.  She is a formidable fighter and the idol of female warriors of all races.  Freya especially looks kindly on spellweavers and helps the Valkyries sort the honorable dead.</p>
                                <p><strong>Freyr</strong> - A Vanir god of light and the god to whom the Alfir are most devoted to.  He is associated with sacral authority, the sun, the cycle of seasons, and prosperity.</p>

                            <p>Stromgard is full of threats- from small and deceptively insidious to world-ending horrors that tear planes of existence apart.  You can see a few examples below:</p>

                                <h3>Kelpies</h3>
                                <p>Kelpies are gross abominations that hang around bodies of water.  They lure in unsuspecting people by taking on the form of a beautiful horse or a woman in distress.  Upon touching the Kelpie, it shifts to its true form- a half rotten monstrosity that partially absorbs its victims and drags it down into the depths to consume.</p>
                            </div>  
                            <br />

                                <p>The Linnorm is a giant, maggot like relative of the dragon, that hibernates underground for long periods of time.  When awake, however, they rampage through the topsoil, leaving decay and rot behind and destroying any structure they come across.</p>

                                <p>When actualizing the Wyrd of Stromgard, we spent a huge amount of time carefully considering how we wanted to portray something that was fundamentally intangible.  Stromgard has an identity that is familiar but it marches to the beat of its own drum and, more than anything else, we really wanted to portray Stromgard as a world full of eschewed convention and surprises.</p>
                                <p>We saw <strong><a href="https://www.elispencer.com/"> Eli Spencer's</a></strong> art for the first time early into the project, way too early to contact about getting art made and the wait was excruciating.  Her style immediately captured our imagination and we knew instantly that her rustic, occult style was exactly the kind of 'lorebook/naturalist' aesthetic we wanted the The Wyrd of Stromgard to be associated with.  Her work is emotional but subtle and she's an absolute wizard at showing the monstrous side of humanity as well as the human side of monsters.  Check her out, you will have a blast going through her work.</p>
                                <p>We trawled many art websites and social media platforms for an artist who could fit the overall look we wanted to give Stromgard's physical components.  We were quite lucky to find <strong><a href="https://camillekuo.com/">Camille Kuo's</a></strong> work.  We were floored right out of the gate.  Her work is robust and lively, full of amazing color and imagination. She designed and painted a beautiful cover for the Wyrd of Stromgard book and the huge sea serpent background for the website and GM screen.</p>
                                <p>We can't thank these talented artists enough for helping us actualize the Wyrd of Stromgard.</p>
