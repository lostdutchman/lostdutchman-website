                                <br />
                                <br />
                                <p>The Wyrd of Stromgard is an expansion for Dungeon World (created by roleplaying wizards Sage LaTorra and Adam Koebel)- it's a sleek, modern ruleset that lets the collaborative narrative of roleplaying lead the way while the mechanics cleverly quantify contest points in an easy to read and easy to learn format.</p>
                                <p>The rules place priority on story telling, while providing a fun and interesting combat system that doesn't bog itself down being unecessarily verbose or complicated.  It's easy to pick up, easy to get good at, and robust enough to handly really complex, nuanced situations in very common sense ways.</p>
                                <p>One of the things Dungeon World mandates is to "draw maps, but leave blanks" and The Wyrd of Stromgard offers the perfect balance of structure and customizabilty to make the GM's job a little easier and simultaneously provide a fantastic, dynamic setting that play groups can alter and customize any way they please.</p>
                                <p>Getting acquainted with Dungeon World is super easy! Just check out <a href="http://www.dungeon-world.com/">Dungeon World's</a> website for all the info you could possibly need.  Even better, Wyrd of Stromgard player classes can play side by side with vanilla Dungeon World characters seamlessly.</p>

                                <br />
                                <p>The Wyrd of Stromgard boasts 5 unique player classes based off mythical archetypes from Norse lore.  Each class represents a wide spectrum of specific narrative feels depending on build and play style.  Movesets were derived from legends and tales, representing what amazing deeds these characters accomplished in their larger than life stories.</p>
                                <img style="padding: 10px 20px 10px 0px; float: left;" src="~/Content/img/bearskin.png" class="img-responsive" /><h3>The Bearskin</h3><p>In the heat of battle they succumb to their bloodrage, transforming them from mortal warrior to a nearly-impervious force of sheer destruction.  The Bearskin cannot keep up their frenzy forever, however, and they crash hard.  A Bearskin's allies also learn quickly to give them room during a fight, lest they wind up amongst the body count.</p>
                                <h3>The Skald</h3>
                                <p>The Skald is a lorekeeper and academic, a highly valued member of society by all classes and creeds.  People believe that Skalds hold great magic in their words and they are often consulted as mediators and regarded as trustworthy enough to have the final say in many grave matters.  Skalds will find it easy to leverage their social status in most situations, from deescalating combat to intentionally inflaming it.  Skalds are also talented fighters in their own right and can hold their own in a hairy situation.</p>
                                <h3>The Hunter</h3>
                                <p>Hailing from a mysterious, shadowy cult, Hunters are devoted to a ghastly phenomenon called The Wild Hunt- a mysterious happening comprised of a demonic hunting party rampaging across the land, dragging unpunished wrongdoers out of their hiding places to Helheim, purgatory for the dishonorable dead.  The Hunter is a vigilante, skilled at stalking in the shadows but a hard hitting, sadistic fighter talented at debilitating their enemies.  They can be quite feral and bloodthirsty, some Hunters are known for very public assassinations.</p>
                                <h3>The Stormcaller</h3>
                                <p>A powerful elementalist, the Stormcaller is a conduit for the natural forces of desctruction in the world.  They can breathe life into ice and snow, summon storms, master the art of lightning step, produce magical weapons, even throw the cycle of seasons out of balance.  A single Stormcaller could make a small fleet of ships utterly unstoppable and their powers are highly sought after.</p>
                                <h3>The Crone</h3>
                                <p>Not many hold the same level of simultaneous fear and respect a Crone does.  Regarded as wisepeople and skilled herbalists, they're also seen as unpredictable and wildly powerful psuedo-deities that could just as easily cause fatal disease as cure it.  To their credit, a Crone does usually quite the array of awful tricks up their sleeves- blights, sickness, mind reading, shadow travel, curses, and Hel knows what else.  Crones may look like a walking pile of dirty robes more often than not, but there is real and tangible terror hiding in that slight form.</p>

The standard classes of Wyrd may be played by any semi-mortal race you choose- elves, dwarves, humans, gnomes, halflings, etc- and instead of the "Racial" starting move of standard Dungeon World, we've replaced it with a more open "Background" move, thereby making all classes available to all races.</p>
                                <p>But The Wyrd of Stromgard also includes 5 racial classes.  These special classes each represent a unique, more powerful race with its own inherent abilities and skills.  These characters are, in some cases, literal demigods and come with unique backgrounds that make them unable to pick up traditional class abilities but are typically more powerful than the average bear, so to speak.  Racial Classes also come with powerful vulnerabilities to temper their strength a little, making them an ideal play choice for those looking for a little challenge.</p>
                                <br />

With unique setbacks like being unable to touch pure iron or stand the sound of bells, individual Fae make the most of their skills by entrancing mortals and magically binding them to contractual terms.  They'll also straight up shank you if they need.</p>
                                <h3>The Troll</h3>
                                <p>Trolls a huge, resilient race who make their homes in the mountain foothills of the world... which are slowly being overrun with humans and other mortals, building villages and cutting timber.  Trolls are hated, told as nighttime stories to misbehaving children, and for the most part they're hunted on sight.  But they're immensely powerful, they could tear a fortified wall down with their bare hands, and fuel their monstrous regenerative powers by consuming huge amounts of food.  Their one weakness is the sun, whose warm light will cause flesh to seize and petrify almost instantly.</p>
                                <h3>The Dvergr</h3>
                                <p>The Dvergr are closely related to common dwarves and share some of their culture.  They are innately magical, however, and retain their more primal forms.  They are creatures of equal parts mundane flesh and living rock, an insular people that have a pragmatic approach to honor and oaths that makes it somewhat difficult to mesh with others.  Their affinity for the earth makes them the best smiths in the land and their deep knowledge of the divine make them an interesting companion. </p>
                                <h3>The Alfir</h3>
                                <p>Literally, the Light Elves.  The Alfir are a sub race of the Vanir, the lesser gods who don't reside is Asgard with the Aesir.  After several Vanir/Aesir conflicts, the Alfir have thrown their lot in with the power hierarchy coming out of Asgard.  They believe strongly that order and gorvernance will bring all the realms to a peaceful age.  Above all they hate those who seek to keep the world wild and chaotic- personified by their almost universal predjudice against J&oumlntar and any who carry their blood.  Most mortal elves and even some rural humans worship the Alfir in some capacity.</p>
                                <h3>The Jotunnborn</h3>
                                <p>The J&oumltunborn are a subgroup inside the wider J&oumltnar people, a race of animalistic ice giants that- as a whole- reject the spread of civilization and hold true to the laws of nature and beasts.  Many J&oumltnar openly and violently rebel against the gods, giving rise to the popular belief that they are actively trying to bring on the apocalypse that will ultimately kill the gods.  However, nearly every race- including the high gods of Asgard- intermarry with J&oumltnar, making loyalties difficult to pin down at a glance.  J&oumltunnborn are just that, the product of a J&oumltnar marriage somewhere in the line that has retained some of their 'ice giant' heritage.  Most J&oumltunnborn have difficulty integrating into groups of people because of entrenched prejudice.</p>

                                <h2>The World</h2>
                                <p>Stromgard is a fictional realm within Midgard, the plane of mortals.  The people of Stromgard are hardy but poor and they value strength, self sufficiency, and honor.  They are a fairly lawful sort, as much as can be expected in a collection of rural settlements, but reputation and morality are weighed heavily in the communities, especially in human ones. 
                                <h3>Societies</h3>
                                <p>Stromgard is primarily populated by humans, who live in a multitude of settlements strewn about the land.  Elves and dwarves both live in Stromgard in great numbers, the former gravitating towards their forest cities and the latter burrowing into every mountain in the region.  Gnomes are also commonly found, typically living close to dwarven communities.  Halfings are also a staple of Stromgardian populations, though they typically only settle where the land is fertile and easily farmed.  More often than not, these societies tend to be racially insular to some degree, though there is no standing bad blood or open feuds between any of these groups as a whole.  Above looks and race, in Stromgard, your honor and strength say more about your worth across all communities.</p>
                                <h3>Conquest</h3>
                                <p>More than anything else, life in Stromgard (for humans, at any rate) is fueled by conquest and exploration.  Every spring, the realm prepares to send out its best boats, helmsmen, and warriors to find new land and also sack the hell out of it.  It is a brutal practice, but the rewards and glory are plentiful.  As is the iminent danger of sea monsters, other warriors, and storms.  Warriors that bring new resources or settle far off lands or even make treaties with foreign ports are lavishly decorated on their return, and their war spoils open many doors for them.</p>
                                <h3>The Nine Realms</h3>
                                <p>The Gods say that the world as we know it sits spread out on the branches of a cosmic tree, divided into nine seperate realms, or planes, as follows:</p>
                                <div class="realms">
                                <p><strong>Asgard</strong> - Home to the Aesir gods and Odin, chief among them</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Vanaheim</strong> - Realm of the lesser gods, the Vanir
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Alfheim</strong> - Realm of the divine light elves
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Myrkheim</strong> - Ancestral home of the dwarven peoples
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Midgard</strong> - Realm of mortals, surrounded by J&oumltunheim, the icy land of the J&oumltnar
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Svaralfheim</strong> - Home of the rarely seen and extremely insular divine moon elves
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Hel</strong> - this realm, ruled by the goddess Hel, houses the dead
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Niflheim</strong> - A special subrealm of Hel for the dishonorable dead
</p>
                                <p>
                                    <strong>Muspelheim</strong> - A plane of pure fire and ash that houses the fire giants and their god-king, Surt
</p>
                                </div>
                                 
                                <h3>The Gods</h3>
                                <p>There are countless deities worshipped all over in varying capacities, their are, however, a few exalted powers that are ubiquitous throughout Stromgard.  Technically, even some ancient and immense J&oumltnar are considered to be gods in their own right.</p>
                                <div class="realms">
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Odin</strong> - Chief among the Aesir deities.  Associated with wisdom, honorable warfare, and prophecy.  It is said that he wanders the world disguised as an old man.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Thor</strong> - A noble and mighty warrior that champions honorable combat, battle prowess, and storms.  Sometimes, Thor is also associated with masculinity and virility, depending on the region.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Tyr</strong> - The voice of law, logic, and reason in Asgard.  Tyr is associated with honorable glory and due process.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Loki</strong> - An enigma.  Loki is considered an Aesir deity but his mixed J&oumltnar parentage make his motives difficult to understand.  Above all, Loki prizes cleverness and wits in his devotees and usually seeks to subvert convention as much as possible.  He is especially honored amongst the outcasted.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Freya</strong> - The warrior goddess Freya is sometimes considered an Aesir and sometimes a Vanir, depending on the region.  She is a formidable fighter and the idol of female warriors of all races.  Freya especially looks kindly on spellweavers and helps the Valkyries sort the honorable dead.
</p>
                                    <p>
                                        <strong>Freyr</strong> - A Vanir god of light and the god to whom the Alfir are most devoted to.  He is associated with sacral authority, the sun, the cycle of seasons, and prospertity.

                                <p>Stromgard is full of threats- from small and deceptively insidious to world-ending horrors that tear planes of existence apart.  You can see a few examples below:</p>   
                                <div class="clearfix">

                                    <p>Kelpies are gross abominations that hang around bodies of                    water.  They lure in unsuspecting people by taking on the form                 of a beautiful horse or a woman in distress.  Upon touching the                Kelpie, it shifts to its true form- a half rotten monstrosity                  that partially absorbs its victims and drags it down into the                  depths to consume.</p>

When                    awake, however, they rampage through the topsoil, leaving decay                and rot behind and destroying any structure they come across.</p>
